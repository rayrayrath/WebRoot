This article is about the differnet types of sensors that can be found in a smartphone. It has some good basic graphics of what each sensor could look like or where you would find it on a phone. Very basic information but still a good place to start to understand what the different types of sensors do.<br />

"The sensor APIs are a set of interfaces built to a common design that expose device sensors in a consistant way to the web platform." Not all sensor data comes from just one sensor. In fact depending on the sensor there are many subclasses that will retrieve speific types of data from a sensor.Sometimes to get an accurate rating there needs to be data pulled from more than once sensor. Feature detection must include both the detection of the API and a defensice programming strategy.Sensor readings cannot be taken unless permission is given to do so.<br />

Using a phones sensors criminals are becoming able to hack into a persons phone, tablet, or PC and exploit the information they collect. One way they are doing this is by listening to a person typing. This allowed people to guess the passowrd within a few tries. As technology continues to advanced, personal data security,is continuing to grow and advance as criminals try new and different ways of trying to get at our personal data.<br />
